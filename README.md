# Multi-Way Machine-Generated Text Classification

This is a project designed to classify text based on its origin—whether it's human-written or generated by a specific language model. The classification task leverages an advanced model chosen after various attempts to accurately identify the source, enhancing our understanding of the nuances in AI-generated content.

Here’s a fun twist: All the texts being classified come from large language models, but the model doing the classifying is a small language model! :)

## Overview

### Task Description
Given a full-text input, this project determines the source of the content. The possible classifications include:

- **Human-Written** - `0`
- **ChatGPT** - `1`
- **Cohere** - `2`
- **Davinci** - `3`
- **Dolly** - `4`
- **Bloomz** - `5`

### Highlights

- **Error Analysis**: 
  - **Cohere vs. ChatGPT**: These models often produce outputs that have similar sentence and grammatical structures, making their distinction challenging.
  - **ChatGPT vs. Davinci**: Both are OpenAI models with ChatGPT being a refined version of Davinci. Their responses share similarities due to their common lineage.
